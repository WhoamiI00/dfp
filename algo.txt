Algorithm: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
Why PPO?

State-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm
Stable and reliable for continuous action spaces (ordering 0-1 fractions)
Good sample efficiency
Works well with neural networks
How it's configured:

Neural Network Architecture:

Default: 2 hidden layers [256, 256 neurons]
Heavy mode: 3 layers [512, 512, 256 neurons]
Uses MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) policy
